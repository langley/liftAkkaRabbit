The goal of this project is to provide a demo and slide deck for a
talk about:  

* Lift: Ajax, Comet and more Actors
* Akka: Actors, Supervisors, Inter Process Communications
* RabbitMQ / Async Messaging

Inspiration and initial examples that illustrated these features came
  from: 

1. Derek Chen-Becker
   https://github.com/samreid/scala-workshop/tree/master/derek-lift-demo
2. Tim Perrett
